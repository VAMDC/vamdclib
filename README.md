This library contains several modules that implement access to VAMDCâ€™s infrastructure. 
It allows to query the central registry service to obtain information about registered 
VAMDC database nodes and to send queries to these nodes as well as to process the retrieved 
data. The data is made available as python dictionaries. Tools to store and manage the
data in a local sqlite3 database or basex - xml database are included.
